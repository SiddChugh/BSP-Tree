This demo project implements a Binary Space Partitioning Tree (*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning*) and several helper functions to query the nearest point in the tree.
The goal of the project was to implement the function *nearestPoint* and write unit tests and a Makefile for testing and compilation purposes.

**Compile:**
Simply type make to compile the source code for BVTree

**Unit Tests:**
To execute unit tests, please type make test to create an executable.
Then type ./BVTreeTest to run all the unit tests.
